(* Since this enum only appears as method parameters, we omit the [to_variant],
   [to_variant_exn], and the type checking functions. *)

(* [`Unknown_value] is a catch-all variant used for valid enum values that have not yet
   been enumerated/or are enumerated incorrectly due to the bindings being out-of-date
   with the latest webidl version.

   If an invalid enum value is constructed using [`Unknown_value] then an exception may be
   thrown when a function is called with [t]. *)
